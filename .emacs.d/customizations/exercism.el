;;; Commentary:

;; Exercism provides functions for interacting with exercises from
;; exercism.io, submitting completed exercises, and fetching new ones.
;; It aims to eventually integrate with exercism unit tests and (possibly?)
;; auto-submit work when all tests pass.

;; The goal is to port the exercism CLI client from Go to elisp, but I think
;; for this first iteration I might just try to shell out to the CLI to run
;; submit and fetch.

(require 'json)
